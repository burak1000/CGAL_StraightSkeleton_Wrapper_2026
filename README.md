also dear martin build library as debug so its not compatible VS2022 or new platform.
so its impossible to use in 2025. also old library use CGAL 4.7

I updated all depencies and rebuild as relase you can add simple your dll file to your C# project.
i make under .NET 4.8 (sorry but i love this framework.)

please reffer to original repo for usage. 
here just contains working dll .
